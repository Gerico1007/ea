 ea - Echoes of Authenticity (Learning Git)  This repository marks my journey to learn Git as a composer who uses AI to bring musical ideas to life. Through 2025, I'll build proficiency in version control, preparing for a dedicated repo for Echoes of Authenticity in 2026, and ultimately, the album release in 2029.

Hello the ea repo now has a README.md file with some content. I'm going to commit this change to the main branch. and link it to an issues in the repo. this will be the issues number 1. each time i make a commit i will reference the issue number in the commit message. this will help me keep track of the changes i make to the repo. for instance, the README.md will always be cited as issue number 1.
