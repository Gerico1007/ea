 ea - Echoes of Authenticity (Learning Git)  This repository marks my journey to learn Git as a composer who uses AI to bring musical ideas to life. Through 2025, I'll build proficiency in version control, preparing for a dedicated repo for Echoes of Authenticity in 2026, and ultimately, the album release in 2029.
